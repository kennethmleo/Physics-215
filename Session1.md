**Session 1: Julia installation and exploration**

- Objective: Successfully Explore Julia
- KR1: Julia can be run using the terminal, the Julia REPL appears
- KR2: Execute via the Julia REPL basic arithmetic expressions such as 2+3, or 3^4
- KR3: Tried several basic mathematical operations such as exponentiation, as well as known functions such as trigonometric and exponents.
- KR4: Switched to the four REPL modes (check the docs for these)
- KR5: Assign a generated ```30x30``` random matrix via the command ```rand()```
- KR6: Try out other basic *tricks* in one of the tutorial pages.



To install Julia, you just need to follow these steps:
1. Download Julia from their [website][1]. I downloaded v1.6.2 for macOS since I am using a macbook.

2. Follow the installation instructions (it was relatively simple).
3. After installing, you should be able to see something like this

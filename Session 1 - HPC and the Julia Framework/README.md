**Session 1: HPC and the Julia Framework**

- Objective: Confirm Julia framework and Base speed
- KR1: Use ```@code_*``` to examine a simple function. The `*` is replaceable by `native`, `typed`, `warntype`, and others. Discover them.
- KR2: Execute via the Julia REPL basic arithmetic expressions such as 2+3, or 3^4
- KR3: Tried several basic mathematical operations such as exponentiation, as well as known functions such as trigonometric and exponents.
- KR4: Switched to the four REPL modes (check the docs for these)
- KR5: Assign a generated ```30x30``` random matrix via the command ```rand()```
- KR6: Try out other basic *tricks* in one of the tutorial pages.

**Session 4: Fast function calls**

- Objective: Compare benchmark times of different implementation of functions that can be expreseed as a recursion relation.
- KR1: Benchmarked at least two (2) different implementation of the same function or process (e.g. raising each element of an array to some power `p`, random array may be used) that utilizes some parameter that can be considered a constant or declared globally. Typical methods: (1) Global variable, (2) Constant global variable, and (3) Named parameter variable.
- KR2: Replicated the naive implementation of the polynomial in the textbook.
- KR3: Replicated the naive implementation of the Horner’s method for the same polynomial.
- KR4: Replicated the macro implementation of the Horner’s method of the same polynomial.
- KR5: Table showing how many minutes will the function evaluations in both KR3 and KR4 be reduced if KR2 requires 24hours of runtime.
